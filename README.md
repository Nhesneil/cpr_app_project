# Mobile application for CPR

The app will not only guide the user on how to do CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) , but will also give the user a feedback on the depth of his/her compressions.

## Features
1.	Depth of compressions feedback (Currently working on)
-	The accelerometer data will be processed to provide accurate feedback to the user
-	The feedback will be through a pre-recorded speech played by the phone saying, "Compress more!"
-	This is an important feature since performing each compressions have a minimum depth to be effective
2.	Rate of compression guide (Yet to be implemented)
-	The beats per minute(bpm) will be presented through a metronome at a fixed rate
3. 	Signal to be sent to authorities (Yet to be implemented)
-	As soon the application gets opened, data such as the location of the user will be sent to the authorities
